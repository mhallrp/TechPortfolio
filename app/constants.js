        <>
            In 2019, I decided to leave my 10+ years of experience in network security behind me to dive into the world of software development. I began with mobile app development utilising the Swift for IoS programming language and both the SwiftUI and UIKit frameworks for front-end and both PhP and mySQL for backend, and I&apos;m proud to have launched multiple apps on the Apple App Store.
        <br/><br/>
            Today, I&apos;m focused more on web development, delving into technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React. My current project involves building a web3 job search and recruitment platform for a Web3.0 platform.
        <br/><br/>
            I&apos;m now actively seeking remote junior roles in software development, with a strong desire for mentoring and growth.
